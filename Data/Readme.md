Data Directory
==============

The Data directory needs to be populated with the dataset that can be found here

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Unzip this into the Data directory before running the code.

The resulting data structure should look as follows:
